### Olivia Brooks | @Cutieguwu

Hiya, welcome to my profile!

I am a High School student with an interest in computer science and engineering, as you can imagine. Going the other direction, I also have an interest in Psychology.

Although I have a rather extensive list below of libraries that I have used/do use, my overall comprehension of them is limited. Rust libraries in particular as I am just getting started with the language. The table is more a reference for myself to jog my memory about stuff. To support that, I will probably devise a better way of sorting everything with the goal to have libraries with their associated languages. Whenever I migrate this README to AsciiDoc instead of MD, will *likely* be when this happens.

As much I as upload projects to Github, none of them ever actually get finished. They have short spurts of rapid development and then I get burnt out, and I restart my obsessive-compulsive cycle elsewhere.

I hope that one day I can actually finish a project and work to maintain it.

I have daily driven Manjaro Linux since about early 2022.
