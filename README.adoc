Hiya, welcome to my profile!

I am a High School student with an interest in computer science and engineering, as you can imagine. Going the other direction, I also have an interest in Psychology.

Although I have a rather extensive list below of libraries that I have used/do use, my overall comprehension of them is limited. Rust libraries in particular as I am just getting started with the language. The table is more a reference for myself to jog my memory about stuff.

As much I as upload projects to Github, none of them ever actually get finished. They have short spurts of rapid development and then I get burnt out, and I restart my obsessive-compulsive cycle elsewhere.

I hope that one day I can actually finish a project and work to maintain it.

I have daily driven Manjaro Linux since about early 2022.

I am not a fan of, nor do I condone the use of "AI", though I do appreciate STT and TTS-only models. I go out of my way to remove AI crap as much as I can. If I can't keep hiding and disabling Github Copilot, I'm moving to Zed the next chance I get.

I do not work nor have any respect for Epic Games. I'm only part of their github organization because I needed to compile UE5 on Linux to do a school project... I hated that project [and the teacher].

== Education
